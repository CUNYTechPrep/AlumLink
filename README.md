# AlumLink Development Setup
Each user will need to do this on their local machine.

## Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed
- Check if you have PostgreSQL installed
  - âœ… versions 10-14 should work
  - ðŸš« version 15 has not been tested
- If you need to install PostgreSQL, see the installing PostgreSQL guides

## Create a PostgreSQL user and database
The project-starter template expects the following for local development:

### PostgreSQL User/Role
- name: `ctp_user`
- password: `ctp_pass`

### PostgreSQL Database
- name: `alumlinkdb`

#### For Windows/pgAdmin users
If you are on Windows and installed pgAdmin, follow our pgAdmin guide to create a user in PostgreSQL named `ctp_user` with the password `ctp_pass` and a database named `alumlinkdb`.

#### For Mac/Linux users
Create a user in PostgreSQL named `ctp_user` with the password `ctp_pass`:

This only needs to be done one time on your machine. You can create additional users if you want to.

- Command to create user: `createuser -P -s -e ctp_user`
- Command to create database: `createdb -h localhost -U ctp_user alumlinkdb`

You will create a DB for each project you start based on this repo. For other projects, change `alumlinkdb` to the new app's database name.

## Running the app locally
For local development, you will need two terminals open, one for the api-backend and another for the react-client.

- Update the `config.json` file and `app.js` in the api folder with the matching username, password, and database name

Clone this app, then:

### To run the project 
cd into AlumLink and download the following dependencies in your terminal:
```
npm install react-router-dom
npm install styled-components
npm install react-icons
npm install axios
```

### api-backend (terminal 1)
- Command:
``` 
cd api
npm install
npm run migrate:up
npm run dev
```

### react-client (terminal 2)
- Command: 
   ```
  cd client
  npm install
  npm start
  ```

api-backend will launch at: `http://localhost:8080`  
react-client will launch at: `http://localhost:3000`
